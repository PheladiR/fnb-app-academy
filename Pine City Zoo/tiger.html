        <h3>TIGERS</h3>
        <p>Tigers are the largest members of the cat family and are known for their striking orange coats with bold black stripes. Each tigerâ€™s stripe pattern is unique, much like a fingerprint. These majestic animals are powerful predators, equipped with strong jaws, sharp teeth, and muscular bodies built for stealth and strength. Tigers are mostly solitary animals and are known to fiercely protect their territories, which can span many kilometers in the wild.</p>
        <p>Tigers are excellent swimmers and often cool off in lakes and rivers. Their diet includes deer, wild boar, and sometimes even larger prey. They rely on their camouflage and quiet movements to stalk and pounce on their targets. Found in forests, grasslands, and mangroves across Asia, tigers are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching. At the Pine City Zoo, you can find our tiger relaxing in its shaded enclosure or playfully pacing near the water; a sight you won't want to miss!</p>
        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
        <p>You will find the tigers at pen T18, opposite Panda Canyon, next to the Monkey Trail and just a short walk from the restaurant.</p>
